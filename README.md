### | About Me  ‚òï üçÇ
My name is Barrett Flowers, `Hello World!` I am a junior developer with experience in python and js; along with a few projects in java.

As a creative, I love simple applications that optimize and simplify work flows. Creating scripts, installers, bots, and more are all right up my alley. Spending hours optimizing my `.tmux.conf`? Absolutely. 

I have also dabbled in game dev, typically I prefer to just use a library and code from the ground up, theres something so satisfying about writing a game essentially from a compiled text file. SFML was a nightmare to work with, fulfilling? when I finally got it to compile without crashing or memory leaks.. Practical? not at all. I had a much better time with pygame. Sure python is slow, but its fun when speed isn't neccesary.

### | Current Endeavor  üíæ
1. Building out my dotfiles repo. 
2. Working on vim motions ;) 
3. Transistion to neovim soon.

### | Homelab  üîå
I love seeing other individuals homelabs and improving upon my own (this seems to be a never-ending cycle, like most things in tech).

`ntfy`, A notification service! \
`openvpn`, Access everywhere! \
`pihole`, Home network dns resolver. \
`piwol`, Wake-on-lan interface for home network devices. \
