## About Me  ☕ 🍂
`Hello World!` my name is Barrett Flowers, a junior developer with a hunger for knowledge- and pumpkin lattes. Retro games, tv shows, books, films.

As a creative (photogtapher), I LOVE simple applications that optimize and simplify work flows. Why overcomplicate it? Creating scripts, installers, and bots are all right up my alley. Spending hours optimizing my `.tmux.conf`? Absolutely.

Theres something so satisfying about writing a game essentially from a compiled text file. SFML was a nightmare to work with. Fulfilling? When I finally got it to compile without crashing or memory leaks... Practical? No not at all. Pygame; however, was a pleasure. Sure Python is slow, but fun when speed isn't neccesary. _Minus indendation errors :D_

### Current Endeavor  💾
[ ] The Rust-lang book and CI/CD pipelines.

### Homelab  🔌
Configuring my homelab is sortof a never-ending addiction...

#### Some services I run: 
`telegram`, A notification service bot! \
`cloudflaretunnel`, Secure reverse proxy tunnels for testing websites. \
`openvpn`, Access everywhere! \
`pihole`, Home network dns resolver. \
`piwol`, Wake-on-lan interface for home network devices. \
`homepage`, A homepage for all my services. \
`nextcloud`, Connects to my smb shares on my nas. _Yes I know smb is less than ideal._
