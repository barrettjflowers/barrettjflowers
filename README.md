## About Me  ‚òï üçÇ
`Hello World!` my name is Barrett Flowers, I'm a junior developer with a hunger for knowledge.

As a creative, I love simple applications that optimize and simplify work flows. Creating scripts, installers, bots, and more are all right up my alley. Spending hours optimizing my `.tmux.conf`? Absolutely. 

I have also dabbled in game dev, typically I prefer to just use a library and code from the ground up, theres something so satisfying about writing a game essentially from a compiled text file. SFML was a nightmare to work with... Fulfilling? when I finally got it to compile without crashing or memory leaks.. Practical? not at all. I had a much better time with pygame. Sure python is slow, but its fun when speed isn't neccesary.

### Current Endeavor  üíæ
Rust and CI/CD pipelines.

### Homelab  üîå
I love seeing other individuals homelabs and improving upon my own (this seems to be a never-ending cycle, like most things in tech).

#### Some services I run: 
`ntfy`, A notification service! \
`cloudflaretunnel`, Reverse proxy tunnels for testing websites. \
`openvpn`, Access everywhere! \
`pihole`, Home network dns resolver. \
`piwol`, Wake-on-lan interface for home network devices. \
`homepage`, A homepage for all my services. \
`nextcloud`, Connects to my smb shares on my nas.
