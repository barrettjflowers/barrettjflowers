## Hello World!  ☕ 🍂 🪴
My alias? Barrett Flowers, a junior developer with a thirst for knowledge- pumpkin lattes, retro games, tv shows, books, and films.

As a creative, unix nerd, and devops aficionado. I LOVE simple applications that optimize and simplify workflows. Why overcomplicate it? Creating scripts, installers, and bots are all right up my alley. Spending hours optimizing my `.vimrc`? Absolutely. 

Theres something so satisfying about writing a game essentially from a compiled text file. SFML was a nightmare to work with. Fulfilling? When I finally got it to compile without crashing or memory leaks... Practical? No not at all. Pygame; however, was a pleasure. Sure Python is slow, but fun when speed isn't neccesary. _Minus indendation errors :D_
