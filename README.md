## About Me ☕🍂

`Hello world!` My name is Barrett Flowers. I am a junior developer with experience in python and js; and experience, albeit minimal, in: c#, c++, and java.

As creative (photographer), I love simple applications that are both beautiful and efficient. I have dabbled in game dev without
the use of a game engine, I put this to rest but one rainy day I may revisit the idea.


## Current Endeavor 💾

I am currently learning React as I do not have as much experience with webdev. I am also attempting to pickup vim motions.


## Homelab 🔌

I love seeing other individuals homelabs and improving upong my own (this seems to be a never-ending cycle, like most things in tech).
Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss
