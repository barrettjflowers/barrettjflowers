## About Me

Hello world! My name is Barrett Flowers. I am a junior developer with experience in python, and js; and experience, albeit minimal, in: c#, c++, and java.

As creative mainly, I love simple applications that are both beautiful and efficient. I have dabbled in game dev without
the use of a game engine, I put this to rest but one rainy day I may revisit the idea.

## Current Endeavor

I am currently trying to learn React as I do not have as much experience with webdev. I am also attempting to pickup vim motions.

## Homelab

I love seeing other individuals homelabs and improving upong my own (this seems to be a never-ending cycle, like most things in tech).
